To install the website for yourself, first download and save the following files to your html directory:

addPhoto.php
animalResults.php
createAccount.php
findAnimal.php
findWildlife.php
getPhoto.php
installInstructions.php
loginVerify.php
logOut.php
newsfeed.php
photo_index.php
userGuide.php
validateUserLocation.php
verifyAccount.php
wildlifeResults.php
WildlifeTracker.php

Next, download the dbConnection.php file and fill in the relevant information for your database. Save that file to the same directory as the other files. Finally, you can create the necessary SQL tables by copying the SQL table creation code from the "Wildlife Tracker Table Definitions" document and loading it into your database. The site should be ready to go now.

One last thing you may want to do is upload sample data to the site. You can find sample data to upload in the "Sample Data.sql" file.
